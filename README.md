# Agent Authority Lab

Experimental security lab: can **deterministic workflow-level state and information-flow enforcement** stop **some modeled** composition attacks that per-action authorization misses?

This is **not** a production system and **not** a proof of general agent safety.

## Status

The original v0.2 specification remains frozen. Subsequent additive experiments are separately frozen and reviewed. They do not rewrite v0.2.

| Layer | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | v0.2–v0.5/I9 composition monitor | Completed experimental slices |
| Phase 2 Exp 01 | Explicit IFC vs authority-only | Hypothesis SUPPORTED *inside the fake lab* |
| Phase 2 Exp 02 | Communication Gate | Hypothesis SUPPORTED *inside the fake lab* |
| Phase 2 Exp 03 | Modeled implicit / control-flow dependency | Hypothesis SUPPORTED *inside modeled control dependencies* |
| Phase 2 repair | Value-id binding (no SENSITIVE→PUBLIC rebind) | Additive. Not Experiment 04. `docs/PHASE2-VALUE-ID-BINDING.md` |
| Tooling | Program-STOP numbers, PBT oracles, CI | Not Experiment 04. See `docs/RESEARCH-METHOD.md` §3.1 and `docs/PBT-ORACLE-v1.md` |

Latest verified suite is recorded in the most recent review. **PASS ≠ SUPPORTED.**

**PASS ≠ SUPPORTED.** Green tests are spec conformance in this fake world. See [docs/RESEARCH-METHOD.md](docs/RESEARCH-METHOD.md).

The lab is separate from 4AllPass. No real credentials, production systems, or secrets.

## Method (canonical)

- [docs/RESEARCH-METHOD.md](docs/RESEARCH-METHOD.md) — PASS vs hypothesis, cycle STOP, program-STOP, CI
- [docs/PBT-ORACLE-v1.md](docs/PBT-ORACLE-v1.md) — Hypothesis contracts (not I9 default-deny)
- [docs/THREAT-MODEL.md](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md)
- [docs/OUT-OF-SCOPE-DEBT.md](docs/OUT-OF-SCOPE-DEBT.md)
- [docs/EVALUATION-MATRIX.md](docs/EVALUATION-MATRIX.md)
- [docs/ADR-002-research-method-and-review-semantics.md](docs/ADR-002-research-method-and-review-semantics.md)
- [docs/ADR-001-I8-I9-action-boundary.md](docs/ADR-001-I8-I9-action-boundary.md) — historical I8/I9 conflict (unchanged)

Historical files titled “Independent Verification” are **not** renamed. Going forward they are read as same-context adversarial / post-implementation verification, not external audits.

## Research question

Can a workflow of individually authorized agent actions still create a forbidden cumulative outcome, and can a small deterministic composition monitor detect those cases without putting an LLM in the trusted core?

## Rules

- Use existing security primitives where possible.
- No custom cryptography.
- No custom capability format unless a concrete gap is demonstrated.
- LLMs may propose actions but must not authorize them.
- Tests are acceptance criteria and must not be weakened to fit an implementation.
- A failed hypothesis is a valid research result.
- Do not expand scope because a review said STOP; a new experiment needs a new frozen spec.
- After every commit, **push** to `origin`. Local-only commits are not done (`scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`).

## Frozen sequence (Phase 1 origin)

1. Spec v0.1
2. Composition Gate
3. Technology decisions
4. Prototype Spec v0.2
5. Build deterministic prototype
6. Test against frozen v0.2
7. Additive slices v0.3–v0.5/I9 and Phase 2 experiments (each frozen separately)

See `docs/` for the frozen design documents. Historical reviews keep their original titles and verdicts.

## v0.2 prototype (deterministic core)

Local composition monitor only. No LLM, no network, no real credentials.

```text
ActionRequest → predict next WorkflowState → evaluate I1–I6
  ALLOW: commit state + provenance
  DENY:  leave state unchanged
```

### Invariants

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| I1 | `action_count <= 100` |
| I2 | unique written files `<= 10` |
| I3 | `config/security-policy.json` is immutable |
| I4 | `delegation_depth <= 1` |
| I5 | any `net.connect` destination is forbidden |
| I6 | `repo.delete` / `release.publish` need `parameters.approval_token` |

**Delegation convention:** root actor depth is 0. `root → A` is depth 1 (allowed). `A → B` is depth 2 (denied).

I4 only constrains the `delegate` action. Independent agents may still submit into the same `workflow_id` at depth 0 (required for the cross-agent accumulation tests). That is not a depth-chain.

### Run tests

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest -q
# CI runs the same suite twice on Python 3.12 (see .github/workflows/test.yml)
```

### What v0.2 does **not** prove

- general agent safety
- alignment or proof of intent
- complete information-flow security
- semantic code safety
- enterprise readiness
- that Biscuit, Cedar, or FIDES would help (not integrated)

A STOP result on the research hypothesis is valid.

## v0.3 (canonical artifact identity)

Additive. Frozen v0.2 is unchanged. See `docs/PROTOTYPE-v0.3.md`.

- Path aliases (`./`, `..`, `//`) collapse before I2/I3.
- **I7:** `file.delete` of `tests/test_security.py` or anything under `tests/security/` needs `approval_token`.

## v0.4 (I8 — mutation completeness)

Additive. Frozen v0.2 and v0.3 are unchanged. See `docs/PROTOTYPE-v0.4.md`.

- Mutating verbs on the protected policy other than `file.write` are DENY (I8). I3 is not relaxed.
- Mutating verbs on security-test artifacts other than `file.delete` need `approval_token` (I8).
- I7 identity matcher is the v0.3 list only (no filename heuristic).
- Not in this slice: global default-deny, I2-on-delete, adapter key canonicalization.

## v0.5 (I9 — unknown action on protected identity)

Additive. Frozen v0.2–v0.4 are unchanged. See `docs/PROTOTYPE-v0.5-I9.md`.

- Unknown action string + protected canonical identity → DENY `I9_UNKNOWN_ACTION_PROTECTED`.
- Exact known/safe vocabulary only. No case folding, no alias interpretation, no LLM.
- I9 does not globally deny unknown actions on ordinary resources.
- `approval_token` does not authorize an unknown policy action.

## Phase 2 (Experiment 01 — IFC composition)

Additive and isolated under `lab/phase2/`. Frozen spec: `docs/PHASE2-EXPERIMENT-01.md`.

Does not amend Phase 1. No LLM. Two labels only (`PUBLIC` / `SENSITIVE`).

A/B: authority-only lets the READ→TRANSFER→EGRESS composition succeed; authority+IFC denies SENSITIVE external egress while PUBLIC egress by B remains ALLOW.

## Phase 2 (Experiment 02 — Communication Gate)

Additive. Frozen spec: `docs/PHASE2-EXPERIMENT-02-COMMUNICATION-GATE.md`. Experiment 01 is unchanged.

Cross-agent transfer is `A → Communication Gate → B`. The gate evaluates metadata only (`evaluate_transfer`). No payload, tools, credentials, or policy writes.

## Phase 2 (Experiment 03 — modeled implicit flow)

Additive. Frozen spec: `docs/PHASE2-EXPERIMENT-03-IMPLICIT-FLOW.md`. Experiments 01–02 unchanged.

Explicit `derived_from` IFC is the baseline. Modeled `control_decide` + `created_under` inherit SENSITIVE across A’s state write so B’s egress can be denied without transferring C1. PUBLIC control-flow egress remains ALLOW. No payload DLP, no LLM.
